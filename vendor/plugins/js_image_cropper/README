== js_image_cropper

The JsImageCropper Plugin provides helper methods to simplify working with the excellent Image Cropper library by David Spurr
available at http://www.defusion.org.uk/code/javascript-image-cropper-ui-using-prototype-scriptaculous/

=== Install

The plugin is ready to use as is. However you must have the cropper javascript and css available.

For convenience a copy is redistributed with this plugin - and can be installed (copied to public/javascripts directory)
using the following rake command:

  rake js_image_cropper:install

=== Configuration

Image Cropper Library requires prototype, scriptaculous builder and scriptaculous dragdrop.

The following will cover it:

  <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults, 'builder', 'cropper' %>

=== Usage

In your view do something like

  <%= image_tag @image.public_path, :id => 'cropMe' %>

  <%= cropper_javascript_tag('cropMe'), {:include_default_on_end_crop_javascript => true }) %>

  <% form_tag(crop_image_url(@image)) do %>
    <%= cropper_form_fields(@project_image.crop_options) %>
    <%= submit_tag("Crop") %>
  <% end %>

This will initialise a simple Image Cropper and a form to submit the crop co-ordinates. More complicated configurations
are possible.

The tests are a good place to look for further examples.

The actual processing of the image must be done elsewhere - like in your model or controller.

is_attachment plugin integrates well - and can be configured to perform the cropping for you.
